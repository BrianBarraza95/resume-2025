# resume-2025

Project

This project was created in Claude AI as a test project to code a one page resume with a mobile breakpoint. It started with a paper sketch in class, evolved into Figma Sketches before taking it into Claude.ai to refine.
This was more of an exploration to get familiar with Claude and learn some basics than to try and make a perfect represeantation of the sketches. I have no real coding experience, so it's also a great opportunity to break down some of the intimidation factor there.

Learning/Impact
I learned that I am super intimidated by coding and all that it entails. I found myself feeling really easily overwhelmed and catastrophizing. I know that my familiarity with coding will come with time, but right now it just feels impenetrable. So I feel like I'm overly reliant on Claude to hold my hand and rather than actually learning the language.

Proudest moment of this project was finally figuring out how to get an image into my final output.

BONUS: Claude edits in another tool

I brought my code into Sublime and ammended the code for the placeholder code to reference an image in a folder that wasn't the same as the text file.
  img src="Img/hero-image.jpg" alt="Brian's profile" class="main-image"

Running Log of Issues/Fixes
Couldn't do the more expressive timeline from my sketches
  Simplified the whole thing to a straight timeline
On the Claude Artifact view, the layout wasn’t what I was looking for
  The artifact window was too small, causing the layout to show in the mobile view.
  I downloaded a chrome extension that lets me see the artifact window at different sizes. This also allowed me to see the mobile and desktop views.
Can’t get a picture to upload. 
  I asked claude directly and it's running me in circles. 
  I think the issue is with the img src tag on line.
    Even dropping in the exact path to the file on my computer it results in a broken image.
    I set up an index file and created a relative path. still didn't work.
  **I brought all my code into Sublime and added the same edits. IT WORKED**
