Claude Resume Issues
Couldn't do the more expressive timeline
  Simplified the whole thing to a straight timeline
Layout wasn’t what I was looking for
  The artifact window was too small, causing the layout to show in the mobile view.
Don’t know how to change the artifact window to see if the responsive design works/ what the mobile layout looks like.
  I downloaded a chrome extension that lets me see the artifact window at different sizes 
Can’t get a picture to upload. 
  I asked claude directly and it's running me in circles. 
  I think the issue is with the img src tag on line.
    Even dropping in the exact path to the file on my computer it results in a broken image.
    I set up an index file and created a relative path. still didn't work.
Can’t get the body text to be the font I want.
